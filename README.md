# DirectX 11 learning project in C# with Silk.NET

So, I wanted to learn D3D11, but learning C++ at the same time would make that harder for me, and I have a time window of only 6 months to achieve that.
I chose D3D11 because I mainly develop on Windows and DirectX works well with Proton on Linux as well.

Silk.NET is a very good C# wrapper of DirectX11 interfaces/methods so I can watch C++ tutorials and replicate everything in C# easily.

Quick comparison table of why I chose C#:

| C# | C++ |
| --- | --- |
| Easy | Hard |
| Slower | Performant |
| I already know it | Need to learn it |
| Uncommon in engine dev | Industry standard |
